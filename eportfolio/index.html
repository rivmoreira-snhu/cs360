      <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> I build real-time, cloud-native personalization systems that translate business
        objectives into measurable outcomes. My career has gone from cryptography technician in the U.S. Navy to
        software developer, senior/manager solution architect and it has been defined by designing distributed systems,
        operationalizing applied AI/ML, and leading cross-functional teams to ship capabilities that actually move KPIs
        (conversion, AHT, NPS). In parallel, completing the B.S. in Computer Science cemented fundamentals in
        algorithms, data structures, operating systems, testing, and graphics, giving me the theory to match my
        production experience. Together, this ePortfolio’s artifacts show end-to-end ownership: requirements > design >
        implementation > testing > data > security > delivery.</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>I design and ship maintainable systems that drive measurable outcomes. Professionally, I’ve led solution
        architecture for real-time, cloud-native personalization. ranslating stakeholder goals into deployableT
        capabilities and validated KPI lift. Academically, completing the B.S. in Computer Science (Aug 2025) solidified
        fundamentals in algorithms, data structures, databases, testing, operating systems, and graphics. This
        ePortfolio integrates both: it shows clear before/after improvements, defensible trade-offs, and a
        security-first posture.</p>

      <h3>Collaboration & Communication</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>I run tight feedback loops. On the job, that means structured code reviews with checklists, design docs
          with explicit trade-offs, and demo-driven increments so stakeholders can see value early. In academic
          projects, it meant writing to rubric and audience, not ego, clear commit messages, and narratives that
          explain why changes exist. I’m comfortable presenting technical content to non-technical leaders (e.g.,
          linking experiment results to financial impact) and translating stakeholder asks into backlog items with
          acceptance criteria. The code review video in this portfolio mirrors how I do it at work: walk the existing
          system, highlight risks, propose changes with rationale, and tie each to outcomes.</li>

      <h3>Security Mindset</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>I eliminated plaintext credential handling by introducing non-reversible hashing for passwords, wrapped
          all DB access in parameterized queries, and validated every user input at the edge. I also checked failure
          paths: errors disclose nothing sensitive, and logs carry enough context to debug without leaking PII. The
          goal is simple: make unsafe states hard to represent and insecure behavior hard to write.</li>

      <h2>How the Artifacts Fit Together</h2>
      <p>
        All enhancements build on a single Android “Minimal Calendar / Event-Tracking” application to show cohesive
        evolution, not isolated fixes.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Software Engineering & Design:</strong> Refactored for readability and testability
          (single-responsibility utilities, centralized schema/constants), added input validation and error handling,
          and replaced plaintext credentials with non-reversible hashing. Result: fewer code paths, clearer contracts,
          easier extension (e.g., RecyclerView) without touching data logic.</li>
        <li><strong>Algorithms & Data Structures:</strong> Introduced deterministic date-keyed grouping
          (<code>Map&lt;String, List&lt;Event&gt;&gt;</code>) for rendering, clarified control flow, and hardened edge
          cases. Result: predictable performance, simpler reasoning about complexity, and a clean path to scalable UI
          components.</li>
        <li><strong>Databases:</strong> Treated local storage like a real DB: WAL enabled, targeted indices,
          conflict-aware writes (<code>insertWithOnConflict</code>), foreign keys on, and versioned migrations (v1 > v2).
          Result: integrity by default, faster hot paths, and safe schema evolution.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The code review serves as an introduction for the original code and understanding how the project is laid out
        while pointing out possible improvements. Each artifact page links to the narrative (PDF), original/enhanced
        code (ZIP),
        and before/after evidence so reviewers can verify claims quickly.</p>
